# Guess the Number Project (July 2022)

I developed this project in July 2022 for practicing Javascript. In this project I developped a webpage by HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. In this website user can "Guess the Number" game. In every match a random integer number between 0 and 100 will be generated. User can predict the correct number in 10 attempts.
